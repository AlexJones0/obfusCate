##### Acknowledgement ####
As mentioned in the main project README, all files in this directory were taken and slightly modified from
pycparser [1], created by Eli Bendersky. These files are incldued to alow programs using standard library
headers to be modified, as otherwise the "single file restriction" of the program would be far too
restrictive, not allowing any programs using standard libraries.

I reiterate, that the code in this directory is *not mine*, and is instead created by Eli Bendersky in 
pycparser [1]. It is reproduced in source form here under the project's license, with the requested 
license preseved at the bottom of this file.
